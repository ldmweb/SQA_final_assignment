The objective of quality assurance is to improve software development and maintenance processes, in order to easier spot weaknesses and errors in the project. Done properly, it allows to reduce the risks of critical bugs and improve the overall quality

This repository is an example software project that demonstrates some of the best practices of Software quality assurance that can be adopted during the development of a project.

You will find a software sample component in **python** for storing information about surveys and responses. Each Survey is made up of multiple Questions (up to a maximum of 10). And should contain an answer to each Question in its Survey, where the answer will be an integer value between 1 and 5

This repository also covers the following themes :

- [**Sprint backlog and task estimation**](#sprint-backlog-and-task-estimation)

- [**Unit testing and Test-Driven development**](#unit-testing-and-test-driven-development)

- [**Test coverage metric**](#test-coverage-metric)
